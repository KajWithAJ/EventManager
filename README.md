# EventManager
Slightly adjusted version of the [original EventManager plugin by k1lly0u](https://umod.org/plugins/event-manager)

## What's different?

I've added a permission `eventmanager.organizer` that will allow people to open events without needing to give them admin access.
I also added a setting on the events when creating or editing them (as an admin) to configure wheter organizers can open the event or not.
